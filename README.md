# flutter_app

This is a reworking, using flutter, of the vol android project done using java. It is a demo of a flight booking appp.
However, due to limitations on the number of projects hostable on firebase under the free tier,
this app will only be a demonstration of what is possible and only store data on the device.
Therefore it does not have the full qualities of a flight booking app. The reserved seat will not be
accessible by other users
